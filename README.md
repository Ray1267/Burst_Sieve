BurstSieve is a local first desktop application for detecting, grouping, and safely removing duplicate and near-duplicate photos generated by high-burst shooting workflows.

It is designed for content producers and marketers who routinely return from shoots with hundreds or thousands of near-identical images and need a faster, lower-risk way to identify usable selects.
The application scans folders entirely offline, groups visually similar images, and recommends a “best” image per group while keeping all actions reversible.

Problem
High burst shooting prevents missed moments but creates a secondary cost:
Hundreds of near-identical images per shoot
Slow, mentally draining manual comparison
Fear of deleting the one valuable frame
Growing storage and organisational overhead
Manual review does not scale and becomes a recurring productivity bottleneck.

Solution
BurstSieve reduces review effort by:
Automatically grouping duplicate and near duplicate images
Highlighting meaningful visual differences rather than individual files
Recommending a conservative “best” image per group
Moving non-selected images to a quarantine folder instead of deleting them
Providing undo support and a full CSV audit trail
The result is a faster, safer, and repeatable post-shoot workflow.

Key features (MVP)
Local folder selection
Offline image scanning (no uploads, no cloud)
Duplicate and near-duplicate detection
Similarity-based grouping
Best-image recommendation per group
Bulk actions on non-selected images
Quarantine-only removals (no hard deletes)
Undo last action
CSV export of all actions taken

Supported formats
JPG
PNG
(HEIC and RAW are intentionally out of scope for v1.)

Design principles
Local-first: all processing happens on-device
Safe by default: no irreversible actions
Transparent: previews, logs, and exports
Trust over automation: conservative recommendations with manual override

Target users
Solo marketers and content producers
Editors handling high-volume burst photography
Small in-house marketing teams
Future junior editors requiring a consistent workflow

Status
This repository contains an MVP implementation focused on validating workflow improvements, accuracy, and user trust. Performance and usability are tested against real-world datasets of up to 1,000 images per folder.
